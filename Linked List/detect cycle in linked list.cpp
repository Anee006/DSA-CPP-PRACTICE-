//DETECT CYCLE IN A LINKED LIST 
//LINKED LIST CYCLE (on leetcode)
//using slow-fast pointer approach

//Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
//Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

//There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 
//Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

//Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
//Output: true
//Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

//Input: head = [1], pos = -1
//Output: false
//Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

//TC = O(n)
//SC = O(1)

    else
    {
        cout << "No cycle detected in the list" <<endl;
    }
    
    return 0;

//NOTE:
//You can't print a list with a cycle in a normal loop â€” it will result in an infinite loop.
//So, while printing, you have to limit the number of nodes you print or detect the cycle.
