//LINKED LIST CYCLE II (on leetcode)
//To find the "start" of a cycle in a linked list
//using slow-fast pointer approach

//Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
//Do not modify the linked list.

//There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 
//Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. 
//Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

//Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
//Output: tail connects to node index 1
//Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

//Input: head = [1], pos = -1
//Output: no cycle
//Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 

//TC = O(n)
//SC = O(1)

//You can't print a list with a cycle in a normal loop â€” it will result in an infinite loop.
//So, while printing, you have to limit the number of nodes you print or detect the cycle.
