//LOWEST COMMON ANCESTOR OF BST (LeetCode 235)

//Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
//The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in tree that has both p and q as descendants 
//(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).‚Äù

//Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
//Output: 6
