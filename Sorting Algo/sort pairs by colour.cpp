// we are given n pairs of items as input, where the first item is a number and the second item is one of three colours (red, blue, or yellow). 
// Further assume that the items are sorted by number.
// Give a O(n) algorithm to sort the items by colour (all reds before all blues before all yellows) such that the numbers for identical colours stay sorted.

// Input: (1, blue), (3, red), (4, blue), (6, yellow), (9, red)
// Output: (3, red), (9, red), (1, blue), (4, blue), (6, yellow)
